* restclient-test.el
~restclient-test.el~ helps you turn [[https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el][restclient.el]] documents into
interactive test suites.

Its functionality is captured by the following animation:

** Usage
A ~restclient.el~ query can be turned into a test by adding a comment
line starting with ~Expect:~ somewhere before the query, followed by
the expected status code. Currently only status code testing is
supported.

The test passes if the expected status code is a substring of the
status code from running the query. So ~Expect: HTTP/1.1 200 OK~,
~Expect: 200 OK~, ~Expect: 200~, and ~Expect: OK~ would all match an
~HTTP/1.1 200 OK~ response.

A full example is shown below (more examples can be found in
[[file:example.http][example.http]]).

#+BEGIN_SRC restclient
  # Expect: 200 OK
  GET http://httpbin.org/get
#+END_SRC

Running ~M-x restclient-test-current~ with point inside the query
updates the buffer with the results of the test:

#+BEGIN_SRC restclient
  # Expect: 200 OK
  # Response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  # Result: Passed
  GET http://httpbin.org/get
#+END_SRC

Running ~M-x restclient-test-buffer~ runs every test found in the
current buffer and displays a summary of the test results in the echo
area.

~M-x flymake-goto-next-error~ and ~M-x flymake-goto-prev-error~ can be
used to quickly jump between failed tests when ~flymake-mode~ is
turned on.

*** restclient-test-mode
~restclient-test-mode~ is a minor mode that sets up key-bindings for
the commands provided by ~restclient-test.el~.

To make ~restclient-test-mode~ activate automatically when
~restclient-mode~ is activated, add the following to your
initialization file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'restclient-mode-hook #'restclient-test-mode)
#+END_SRC

And to turn on Flymake automatically for ~restclient-test-mode~
buffers:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'restclient-test-mode-hook #'flymake-mode)
#+END_SRC

The following table summarizes the key-bindings set up by
~restclient-test-mode~.

| Key binding        | Command                          |
|--------------------+----------------------------------|
| ~C-c C-b~          | ~restclient-test-buffer~         |
| ~C-c C-t~          | ~restclient-test-current~        |
